	<p> EcoCycle is a small non-profit organization started by a Santa Clara University students to organize recycling projects on our campus as well as other colleges in California.We see this as an incredible opportunity to help change the world—and more importantly,our campus by making sustainable disposable products.Sustainable disposables sound like an oxymoron, but we live in a consumer culture where 	disposable products are ubiquitous.

		<p>
		Our planet is sick and crying for help. Let’s take a look at its future. Should we wait for governmental actions or should we act by ourselves? See the natural cycle, the human impacts on the environment, the prognosis, memorize the top recyclable materials and be a voluntary.
		</p>
		<p>
		Once upon a time there was a blue planet called Earth. It was full of wonderful things and paradises like the Alps in Switzerland, Kenya in South Africa, Yosemite National Park in the United States, Patagonia in Argentina and the Fujiyama in Japan. You could see as well whales, insects, Jacaranda trees in Pretoria (South Africa), waterfalls, paradisiacal fruits and much more.
		</p>
		<p>
		But while the time was passing and the humans were destroying, the poor planet heated up.
		</p>
		<p>
		This planet still exists. But does it have a future? Which future might this be?
		</p>
		<p>
		The scientists’ forecast isn’t very colored, actually it is very dark, almost  black. It is a nightmare.
		</p>
		<p>
	    They proved that the human activities in the environment are heating up the planet and the consequences can be dramatic for the next generations.
		We should take care of our planet, like we take care of our children.
		</p>
		<p>
	    Think about it very well…because by now we have only this planet for living. Mother Earth will thank you. Namaste.
